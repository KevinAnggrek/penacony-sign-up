# Penacony Sign-up Form

> ***May our journey lead us starward!***
  

This is my attempt to work on [The Odin Project's Sign-up Form mini project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).
I recently played a lot of Honkai Star Rail and spent a lot of time travelling through Penacony.

Through this project, I would like to practice what I have learned up until this point and also capture the beauty of the dreamscape through this form.
Things that I am planning to implement with this project:
1. Intermediate HTML:
	- Implement intermediate HTML elements
	- Use Emmet when writing HTML tags
	- Use SVG/Table as needed
2. Intermediate CSS:
	- Use CSS Reset
	- Implement text styles (fonts, sizes, etc)
	- Implement useful CSS properties such as Background, Borders, box-shadows, Overflow, Opacity, etc
	- Use Advanced CSS Selectors (Combinators, Pseudo-classes, and Pseudo-elements)
	- Use CSS Positioning
	- Use various CSS functions in the stylesheet
	- Use CSS Custom Properties
	- Ensure browser compatibility
3. Forms:
	- Use and implement various Form controls and elements
	- Style the Form and its controls
	- Form Validation
